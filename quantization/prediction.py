class JointCodebookLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    This module predicts a group of codebook indexes from a vector.  The idea is that
    you have a number of codebooks (probably jointly trained), from class Quantizer,
    and you want to predict the probabilities of the codebook entries based on some
    predictor that you are training.

    The simplest thing would be to project the vector using nn.Linear, then
    reshape and use logsoftmax to normalize the probabilities within each group,
    then compute the likelihood.  However, this has a constraint that all the
    codebooks are predicted independently of each other.  This module allows you
    to predict them jointly, by regressing each codebook on all previous codebooks.
    This is done with a nonlinearity in which the previous codebook entries are combined
    with the input predictor vector, so that the regression is not purely
    linear.

    Args:
        predictor_dim: the number of features that we use to predict the codebook
               indexes, e.g. 2048 (will depend on your model).
        hidden_dim:  a hidden dimension in the model; should be more than
                codebook_size, but may be less or more than predictor_dim.

        num_codebooks: the number of codebooks that you are predicting;
               will likely be the same as the bytes_per_frame given to the
               QuantizerTrainer that you used to train the Quantizer you
               are predicting.
        codebook_size: number of entries per codebook (often 256)
        self_prediction: you can set this to false to enable prediction of
              codebooks by earlier-numbered codebooks
        hidden_dim: the hidden dimension per codebook (we use a 1-hidden-layer
              network, with a ReLU and then batchnorm).
        checkpoint: if true, reduce backprop memory at the expense of doing
              the computation twice.
